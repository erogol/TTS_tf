- [ ] Catching up with TTS pytorch
    - [x] Replace pytorch layers with TF
    - [x] Basic eager mode training 
        - 5x times slower than pytorch (if you see any easy optimizations, please let me know.)
    - [ ] Optimization with tf.function
        - tf.function looks so hard to use with models having different input shapes per iteration since TF retraces the graph for each input. As far as I see from the official examples, workarounds take the advantage of using eager mode. (Correct me if I am wrong.)
